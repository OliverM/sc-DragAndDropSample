Project:   DragAndDrop

==========================================================================

A minimal implementation of drag and drop between views in Sproutcore. The red view on the left is a source, and the blue view on the right is a drop target. Drag the red view to the blue view to complete a drag and drop operation. Console messages track the operation's progress.
